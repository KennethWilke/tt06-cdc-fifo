## How it works

This is a FIFO that can pass data asynchronously across clock domains. This was a project I created when I was first learning logic design, and it took me a couple weeks to settle on a design that I felt was clean and reusable.

The original design can be found at [https://github.com/KennethWilke/sv-cdc-fifo](https://github.com/KennethWilke/sv-cdc-fifo)

The architecture of this design was influenced by
[this paper](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf)
written by Clifford E. Cummings of
[Sunburst Design](http://www.sunburst-design.com) by the implementation was fully written by me. 

## How to test

Abandon all hope, ye who enter...

I need to write this!
